# Imdb-Movies

- Extracted the name, year of release and Imdb ratings for top 250 movies of all times
- Used the Imdb webiste for the same (https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/?ref_=nv_mv_250)
- Used the BeautifulSoup package of python to do the same
- In the future, I am going to add code to add more columns, such as description, actor names, etc into the same file
